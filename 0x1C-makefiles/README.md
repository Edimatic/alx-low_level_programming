# MakeFiles
A Makefile is a text file used in software development to automate the compilation and building of programs or software projects. It contains a set of instructions (rules) for building software from source code files. Makefiles are commonly used in projects written in languages such as C, C++, and similar compiled languages.

# Here's how a Makefile typically works:

    Targets: Each rule in a Makefile defines a target. A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by the build process, like an executable binary or an object file.

    Dependencies: Each target may have dependencies, which are files required for building the target. If any dependency is newer than the target or does not exist, the target needs to be rebuilt.

    Commands: For each target, the Makefile specifies the commands needed to build that target. These commands are typically shell commands, such as compilation commands for source files.
